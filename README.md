# Robotic Arm Calibration and Path Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on calibrating and visualizing the movement of a robotic arm using sensor data.

## Features
- **Sensor Calibration**: Used voltage signals from base and elbow sensors to calculate angular measurements through linear regression.
- **Path Computation**: Transformed angular measurements into Cartesian coordinates using trigonometric functions.
- **Data Visualization**: Created scatter plots and trendlines to illustrate the relationship between sensor signals and angular outputs, as well as the robotic arm's computed path.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Languages**: C
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Microsoft Excel

## Dataset
The dataset includes over 1,000 sensor readings recorded during the operation of the robotic arm. The readings consist of:
- Voltage signals from base and elbow sensors
- Corresponding angular measurements

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Recorded sensor voltage data during robotic arm operations.
2. **Calibration**: Applied linear regression techniques to correlate voltage signals with angular measurements.
3. **Path Computation**: Used trigonometric transformations to convert angular data into Cartesian coordinates.
4. **Visualization**: Generated scatter plots and trendlines in Excel to visualize data relationships and the robotic arm's computed movements.

## Results
- Developed accurate calibration curves that link voltage signals to angular measurements.
- Computed and visualized the robotic arm's path in Cartesian coordinates with precision.
